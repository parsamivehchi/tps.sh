    system: "You are a senior software engineer. Write clean, well-tested code."
    prompt: |
      Write a Python function `binary_search(arr, target)` that performs binary search
      on a sorted list. It should return the index of the target if found, or -1 if not found.

      Also write at least 5 unit tests using pytest that cover:
      - Target found at beginning, middle, end
      - Target not found
      - Empty list
      - Single element list
      - Duplicate elements

    prompt: |
      Create a reusable React DataTable component in TypeScript with the following features:

      1. Accept generic typed data via props
      2. Sortable columns (click header to toggle asc/desc)
      3. Pagination (configurable page size)
      4. Search/filter across all columns
      5. Loading and empty states

      Include the component, its types, and a usage example with sample data.

      Build a complete FastAPI CRUD API for a "Task" resource with the following:

      - Pydantic models: TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskResponse
      - Fields: id (UUID), title (str), description (optional str), status (enum: todo/in_progress/done), created_at, updated_at
      - Endpoints: POST /tasks, GET /tasks (with pagination), GET /tasks/{id}, PUT /tasks/{id}, DELETE /tasks/{id}
      - In-memory storage (dict)
      - Proper error handling with HTTPException
      - Include example requests/responses in docstrings
