  - id: et_python_gil
    title: "Python GIL Explained"
    system: "You are a CS educator who explains complex topics clearly with examples."
    prompt: |
      Explain the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) for an intermediate Python developer.

      Cover:
      1. What the GIL is and why CPython has it (reference counting, memory safety)
      2. How it affects multi-threaded Python programs (with code examples)
      3. When threads ARE useful despite the GIL (I/O-bound vs CPU-bound)
      4. Demonstrate with benchmarks: threading vs multiprocessing for CPU-bound work
      5. Workarounds: multiprocessing, C extensions, asyncio, sub-interpreters (3.12+)
      6. What other Python implementations do (PyPy, Jython, the free-threading PEP 703)
      7. Common misconceptions and gotchas

      Include runnable Python code examples with expected output.

  - id: et_git_rebase_merge
    title: "Git Rebase vs Merge Tutorial"
    system: "You are a DevOps educator. Use clear diagrams and examples."
    prompt: |
      Create a comprehensive tutorial explaining git rebase vs git merge for a developer
      who understands basic git but hasn't used rebase.

      Include:
      1. Visual ASCII diagrams showing commit history for both approaches
      2. Step-by-step walkthrough of a real scenario (feature branch, main has new commits)
      3. When to use merge vs rebase (team conventions, public vs private branches)
      4. Interactive rebase (squash, fixup, reword, edit) with examples
      5. The "golden rule" of rebasing (never rebase public branches)
      6. How to handle rebase conflicts (step by step)
      7. Common workflows: rebase-then-merge, squash merge, merge commits
      8. Recovering from a bad rebase (reflog)

      Use concrete git commands with example output.

  - id: et_database_indexing
    title: "Database Indexing Deep Dive"
    system: "You are a database internals expert teaching senior developers."
    prompt: |
      Write a deep-dive tutorial on database indexing for PostgreSQL.

      Cover:
      1. How B-tree indexes work internally (with ASCII diagrams of the tree structure)
      2. Index types: B-tree, Hash, GiST, GIN, BRIN — when to use each
      3. Composite indexes: column order matters (explain with query examples)
      4. Covering indexes (INCLUDE) to avoid table lookups
      5. Partial indexes for filtered queries
      6. Index-only scans vs index scans vs bitmap scans
      7. EXPLAIN ANALYZE walkthrough (reading query plans)
      8. Common indexing mistakes (over-indexing, wrong column order, unused indexes)
      9. Monitoring: pg_stat_user_indexes, index bloat, maintenance

      Include CREATE INDEX statements and EXPLAIN ANALYZE output examples.
